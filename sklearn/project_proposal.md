# Project Proposal

The purpose of this project is to build the machine learning model to identify and prevent credit card fraud. This includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be a fraud. The model will then be used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Data

The main dataset for this project will be taked from kaggle.com.

## Tools

The analysis will be done in python. Pandas will be used for EDA and manipulation. sklearn will be used for modeling. matplotlib and seaborn will be used for visualization.

## MVP

The MVP for this project will be a classification model will one or two features and its affect on the target
