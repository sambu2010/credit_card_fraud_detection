### Credit Card Fraud Prediction

The purpose of this project is to build the machine learning model to identify and prevent credit card fraud. This includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be a fraud. The model will then be used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not.

To start exploring this goal I built the process workflow of how this project will be developed.

 This is a first draft version and may change as the project goes on.
